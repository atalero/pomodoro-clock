A Pomodoro clock is a timer for which you can set time intervals for breaks and sessions. It is useful for working and studying because it helps you focus and make efficient use of your time. JavaScript timing events are the cornerstone of this project. The user may change pause/unpause the clock or change the length of time for breaks or sessions at any time.
